#The Guardian's 100 Greatest Books of All Time

I love to read. I've been lucky enough to have fantastic mentors when choosing books and new authors. I began reading the Guardian's 100 Greatest Books of All Time because I didn't feel like I had enough classical history. 

To help me remember what I have and have not read, I will keep record with the help of Markdown. Titles in bold I have already read.

>  "This list of the 100 best books of all time was prepared by Norwegian Book Clubs. They asked 100 authors from 54 countries around the world to nominate the ten books which have had the most decisive impact on the cultural history of the world, and left a mark on the authors' own thinking. Don Quixote was named as the top book in history but otherwise no ranking was provided."

##My Favorites so far

![](http://covers.feedbooks.net/book/1232.jpg?size=large&t=1437534696)

Definitely the most challenging of all the books I read- it took me a solid year of reading just a few pages at a time. I had a special annotated guide that took me line by line and really illuminated a lot of the stream of consciousness style. However confusing and challenging it was, *Ulysses* will continue to be my favorite book of all time.

![](https://www.spinelessclassics.com/src/War-and-Peace-Single-sheet-_664966_h800.jpg)

Although many consider *War and Peace* to be one of the most difficult novels in print, I found that it's probably not due to the subject matter, but to the sheer number of characters- nearly 600 total! I think the reason that I could read this at all was because at the time, I was in the Peace Corps, so I could spend hours reading and not get lost in the names because I was never away from them for very long. Overall, I found this book delightful and optimistic. Although I've read a lot of other novels by Tolstoy, this one remains my favorite!

This was one of the first books I read off this list. It is a collection of different colored notebooks that, when combined, create a total, golden, notebook. I like to think of that meaning that all the varied, different parts of our lives, especially the lives of women, can combine to make something beautiful.

So, book nerd alert:  I read *Crime and Punishment, The Brothers Karamazov,* and *The Idiot* in two weeks. I was off from work and sick, and just went charging through each of them. This one, Brothers Karamazov, was the last one I read, and I don't know if it was the delerium of my fever or the fact that I had spent the last two weeks reading, but I saw the whole book play out in my head as a movie, specifically one directed by Sofia Coppola- highly stylized with an excellent soundtrack! But again. Probably the fever.

As a young lesbian, I thought the world began and ended with *Mrs. Dalloway,* but it wasn't until I read *To the Lighthouse* that I appreciated Virginia Woolf not just as a writer, but as a genius. In this book, she creates a method of using point of view that I have never since seen again- seemingly normal scenes overlap based on who's experiencing the moment. Just beautifully written.

*Things Fall Apart* was the very first book I read from this list, and the one I finished the quickest- start to finish in a day. It was just so good! This story is about a chief of an African tribe having to face colonialism and westernization. It was interesting to love this book so much and carry the experience of it, what I learned from it, to Africa with me while I lived there. It taught me so much about culture and heritage, and the death of tradition in the face of "progress."

This is an interesting choice for me when there are still so many authors and books above that I haven't mentioned yet- but this one will always be my my favorite not because of how it is written (which I usually qualify as being the best part of a good book), but how it made me feel, and what it made me question. The thing that's easy to read about the Book of Job is that it seems like a straightforward story, and depending on how you read into it, maintains that message we all know- love God no matter what, even when He leaves you, He hasn't- etc. I read this book many times as a kid, as a teenager- it wasn't until I was older and evaluating real ideals of good and evil that I came across the Book of Job as being more than just a story of blind faith.

*(Above: example of a quote that supports a literal interpretation, and what many readers walk away with after reading The Book of Job. I* ***disagree*** *with this analysis)*

I believe there's more to it than just simply throwing up your hands and saying "God works in mysterious ways" or "He has a plan for us." I think that's the easy way out. I think it's more comfortable to feel helpless than to feel angry- there is more opportunity for closure if you say that God makes bad things happen because He has a plan, rather than asking the question *"Why did this happen?"* and hearing no response from God. 

I prefer this quote from Anne Lamott:
